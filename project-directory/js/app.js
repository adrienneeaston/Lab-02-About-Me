'use strict'

// Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. 

// The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, 
// and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() 
// or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.

// Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to 
// the browser console for each question of the guessing game.

var dogs = prompt('How many dogs do I own');
